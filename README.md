# ChromeEXT

Hi!

The goal of this project is to build a cosmetic ingredient checker as a chrome extension. Once activated, the extension should detect any and all ingredients on a users web page. It will then display a pop-up notification of the ingredients and vital information assoicated with it. 

Tasks 

Completed as of right now:

• Developed a Python script that scrapes titles, descriptions, and urls from an ingredient dictionary and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. Built with Python and the Beautiful Soup library.

In Progress:

• Utilizing Django framework to construct HTTP requests to a database for extracting and displaying information on the chrome extension. 

• User interface design in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
