[<p>Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are destructive substances generated in the body when we consume refined sugars and due to environmental exposure without adequate protection. But first, a bit of backstory…</p>, <p>One of the more depressing skincare facts we can think of is how bad dietary sugar or high glycemic index foods (foods that turn to sugar almost immediately after eating them) are for almost every aspect of your skin. Chocolate cake, honey-drenched sweets, ice cream sundaes, bread pudding, and on and on (and we could go on and on) cause very bad things to happen to skin. UV light and air pollutants are attacking your skin from the outside in, and sugar is attacking it from the inside out.</p>, <p>What’s the relationship between sugar and AGEs? Sugars quickly and strongly bind to proteins in the skin (proteins are the main building blocks of skin) forming AGEs that progressively and continually destroy many aspects of skin, especially elastin and collagen, the two substances that give skin its firmness and resilience. Once generated, AGEs begin a cascade of progressive damage that isn’t easy to stop or reverse.</p>, <p>Research has also shown AGEs can cause abnormal melanin production that leads to the formation of brown spots and mottled skin discolorations. Another ironic acronym for this is RAGEs, meaning a receptor site for AGEs that induces unhealthy melanin production.</p>, <p>Although sugar is certainly a major culprit in the skin-damaging creation of AGEs, so is something called the Maillard Reaction (MR). The Maillard Reaction is what happens when you cook any food and brown or blacken it with high heat. That means steaming or sautéing food without browning is far healthier for your skin and body. And chargrilling foods, especially meats, at high heat is even worse! Our apologies to those who prefer their steaks well done.</p>, <p>While some skincare companies claim their products contain ingredients that can block AGEs from forming, that benefit hasn’t been supported anywhere in the research. In the meantime, while science is working on this insidious problem, eating a low sugar diet that’s rich in antioxidants, complex carbohydrates, and omega fatty acids is by far the best approach for younger-looking, healthy skin from the inside out (and when you put those ingredients on your skin it can help from the outside in too, it’s just not clear how much that helps control the visible effects of AGEs; however, a huge amount of research shows those ingredients to be beneficial for skin overall).</p>, <p>What about the occasional sweet treat? Although we can’t change what eating refined sugars does to your skin (and yes, this includes so-called sugar substitutes like raw honey and agave nectar, both of which the body recognizes as simple sugars), we also realize that sweets play a role in the pleasures of eating and celebrating. The trick is to keep it in moderation, meaning an occasional, judicious indulgence rather than daily consumption of desserts, sugary sodas, and flavored coffee drinks, the latter of which can contain an alarming amount of sugars.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong><br/> <em>Journal of Agricultural Food Chemistry</em>, February 2018, pages 1,325-1,329<br/> <em>Advances in Nutrition</em>, January 2017, pages 54-62<br/> <em>Dermato-endocrinology</em>, October 2017, page 9<br/> <em>Skin Pharmacology and Physiology</em>, May 2016, pages 231-242<br/> <em>Skin Therapy Letter</em>, November 2015, pages 1-5<br/> <em>Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine</em>, January 2014, pages 169-174<br/> <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, March 14, 2000, pages 2809–2813.</p>]

[<p>"Alcohol" refers to a group of organic compounds with a vast range of forms and uses in cosmetics and in other types of products and solutions. </p>, <p>For skin, there are good alcohols and bad alcohols, corresponding to high-molecular-weight alcohols and low-molecular-weight alcohols, respectively, which can have emollient properties (cetyl alcohol) or act as detergent cleansing agents like isopropanol. </p>, <p>There also are benign forms, including glycols, which are used as humectants to help hydrate and deliver ingredients into skin’s uppermost layers.</p>, <p>Alcohols with low molecular weights—the bad-for-skin kind—can be drying and sensitizing. The alcohols to be concerned about in skincare products are <strong>ethanol or ethyl alcohol, denatured alcohol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, SD alcohol, and benzyl alcohol</strong>. The concern is when one or more of these are listed among the main ingredients; tiny amounts in an otherwise good formula aren’t a problem.</p>, <p><strong><a href="https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/basic-skin-care-tips/alcohol-in-skin-care-the-facts.html">In addition to being drying and sensitizing, these alcohols can disrupt skin’s surface layers</a></strong>. Alcohol helps ingredients like retinol and vitamin C penetrate into the skin more effectively, but it does that by breaking down the surface layers of skin—destroying the very substances that keep your skin feeling healthier and looking younger over the long term.</p>, <p>Alcohols like SD and "denatured" immediately harm the skin, starting a chain reaction of damage that continues long after it has evaporated. A 2003 study published found that with regular exposure to alcohol-based products, cleansing becomes a damaging ordeal—skin is no longer able to keep water and cleansing agents from penetrating into it, thus further eroding its surface layers.</p>, <p>It also destroyed the substances in skin that help to naturally soothe and defend it against visible effects of environmental damage.</p>, <p>If that weren’t bad enough, exposure to alcohol causes healthy substances in skin to literally self-destruct. The research also showed that these destructive, aging effects on skin’s substances increased the longer the exposure to alcohol; that is, two days of exposure was dramatically more harmful than one day, and that is only from exposure to a 3% concentration (most skincare products with denatured alcohol contain greater amounts than that).</p>, <p>In short, for the healthy appearance of skin at any age, avoiding products that contain high amounts of the drying, sensitizing types of alcohol is a non-negotiable skincare must.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong><br/> <em>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta</em>, May 2012, issue 4, page 1410<br/> <em>Aging</em>, March 2012, issue 3, pages 166-175<br/> <em>Chemical Immunology and Allergy</em>, March 2012, pages 77-80<br/><em>Dermato-Endocrinology</em>, January 2011, issue 1, pages 41-49<br/> <em>Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology</em>, November 2008, issue 3<br/><em>Experimental Dermatology</em>, June 2008, issue 6, pages 542-551<br/> <em>Clinical Dermatology</em>, September-October 2004, issue 5, pages 360-366<br/> <em>The Journal of Hospital Infection</em>, December 2003, issue 4, pages 239-245<br/> <em>Alcohol Journal</em>, April 2002, issue 3, pages 179-190</p>]
