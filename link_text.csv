[<p>Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are destructive substances generated in the body when we consume refined sugars and due to environmental exposure without adequate protection. But first, a bit of backstory…</p>, <p>One of the more depressing skincare facts we can think of is how bad dietary sugar or high glycemic index foods (foods that turn to sugar almost immediately after eating them) are for almost every aspect of your skin. Chocolate cake, honey-drenched sweets, ice cream sundaes, bread pudding, and on and on (and we could go on and on) cause very bad things to happen to skin. UV light and air pollutants are attacking your skin from the outside in, and sugar is attacking it from the inside out.</p>, <p>What’s the relationship between sugar and AGEs? Sugars quickly and strongly bind to proteins in the skin (proteins are the main building blocks of skin) forming AGEs that progressively and continually destroy many aspects of skin, especially elastin and collagen, the two substances that give skin its firmness and resilience. Once generated, AGEs begin a cascade of progressive damage that isn’t easy to stop or reverse.</p>, <p>Research has also shown AGEs can cause abnormal melanin production that leads to the formation of brown spots and mottled skin discolorations. Another ironic acronym for this is RAGEs, meaning a receptor site for AGEs that induces unhealthy melanin production.</p>, <p>Although sugar is certainly a major culprit in the skin-damaging creation of AGEs, so is something called the Maillard Reaction (MR). The Maillard Reaction is what happens when you cook any food and brown or blacken it with high heat. That means steaming or sautéing food without browning is far healthier for your skin and body. And chargrilling foods, especially meats, at high heat is even worse! Our apologies to those who prefer their steaks well done.</p>, <p>While some skincare companies claim their products contain ingredients that can block AGEs from forming, that benefit hasn’t been supported anywhere in the research. In the meantime, while science is working on this insidious problem, eating a low sugar diet that’s rich in antioxidants, complex carbohydrates, and omega fatty acids is by far the best approach for younger-looking, healthy skin from the inside out (and when you put those ingredients on your skin it can help from the outside in too, it’s just not clear how much that helps control the visible effects of AGEs; however, a huge amount of research shows those ingredients to be beneficial for skin overall).</p>, <p>What about the occasional sweet treat? Although we can’t change what eating refined sugars does to your skin (and yes, this includes so-called sugar substitutes like raw honey and agave nectar, both of which the body recognizes as simple sugars), we also realize that sweets play a role in the pleasures of eating and celebrating. The trick is to keep it in moderation, meaning an occasional, judicious indulgence rather than daily consumption of desserts, sugary sodas, and flavored coffee drinks, the latter of which can contain an alarming amount of sugars.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong><br/> <em>Journal of Agricultural Food Chemistry</em>, February 2018, pages 1,325-1,329<br/> <em>Advances in Nutrition</em>, January 2017, pages 54-62<br/> <em>Dermato-endocrinology</em>, October 2017, page 9<br/> <em>Skin Pharmacology and Physiology</em>, May 2016, pages 231-242<br/> <em>Skin Therapy Letter</em>, November 2015, pages 1-5<br/> <em>Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine</em>, January 2014, pages 169-174<br/> <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, March 14, 2000, pages 2809–2813.</p>]

[<p>"Alcohol" refers to a group of organic compounds with a vast range of forms and uses in cosmetics and in other types of products and solutions. </p>, <p>For skin, there are good alcohols and bad alcohols, corresponding to high-molecular-weight alcohols and low-molecular-weight alcohols, respectively, which can have emollient properties (cetyl alcohol) or act as detergent cleansing agents like isopropanol. </p>, <p>There also are benign forms, including glycols, which are used as humectants to help hydrate and deliver ingredients into skin’s uppermost layers.</p>, <p>Alcohols with low molecular weights—the bad-for-skin kind—can be drying and sensitizing. The alcohols to be concerned about in skincare products are <strong>ethanol or ethyl alcohol, denatured alcohol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, SD alcohol, and benzyl alcohol</strong>. The concern is when one or more of these are listed among the main ingredients; tiny amounts in an otherwise good formula aren’t a problem.</p>, <p><strong><a href="https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/basic-skin-care-tips/alcohol-in-skin-care-the-facts.html">In addition to being drying and sensitizing, these alcohols can disrupt skin’s surface layers</a></strong>. Alcohol helps ingredients like retinol and vitamin C penetrate into the skin more effectively, but it does that by breaking down the surface layers of skin—destroying the very substances that keep your skin feeling healthier and looking younger over the long term.</p>, <p>Alcohols like SD and "denatured" immediately harm the skin, starting a chain reaction of damage that continues long after it has evaporated. A 2003 study published found that with regular exposure to alcohol-based products, cleansing becomes a damaging ordeal—skin is no longer able to keep water and cleansing agents from penetrating into it, thus further eroding its surface layers.</p>, <p>It also destroyed the substances in skin that help to naturally soothe and defend it against visible effects of environmental damage.</p>, <p>If that weren’t bad enough, exposure to alcohol causes healthy substances in skin to literally self-destruct. The research also showed that these destructive, aging effects on skin’s substances increased the longer the exposure to alcohol; that is, two days of exposure was dramatically more harmful than one day, and that is only from exposure to a 3% concentration (most skincare products with denatured alcohol contain greater amounts than that).</p>, <p>In short, for the healthy appearance of skin at any age, avoiding products that contain high amounts of the drying, sensitizing types of alcohol is a non-negotiable skincare must.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong><br/> <em>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta</em>, May 2012, issue 4, page 1410<br/> <em>Aging</em>, March 2012, issue 3, pages 166-175<br/> <em>Chemical Immunology and Allergy</em>, March 2012, pages 77-80<br/><em>Dermato-Endocrinology</em>, January 2011, issue 1, pages 41-49<br/> <em>Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology</em>, November 2008, issue 3<br/><em>Experimental Dermatology</em>, June 2008, issue 6, pages 542-551<br/> <em>Clinical Dermatology</em>, September-October 2004, issue 5, pages 360-366<br/> <em>The Journal of Hospital Infection</em>, December 2003, issue 4, pages 239-245<br/> <em>Alcohol Journal</em>, April 2002, issue 3, pages 179-190</p>]

[<p>Aluminum is the most common element on Earth. It's also a common source of confusion in terms of its presence in cosmetics, specifically whether that presence poses a health risk. The fact is, when you read "aluminum" on an ingredient list, it isn't pure aluminum—not even close.</p>, <p>Pure aluminum is not added to any skincare or makeup product. Rather, compounds (mixtures of aluminum), such as aluminum combined with other natural elements, are safety used in a variety of ways in personal care products, foods and medicines. These compounds contain only traces of aluminum, and in daily use over the long term are perfectly safe. Such ingredients actually contain less aluminum than what occurs naturally in plants, vegetables or even in the human body).</p>, <p>Here are a few examples of the most common aluminum compounds used as ingredients in cosmetics, and a brief description of what they are (as well as their global safety status).</p>, <p><strong> </strong>In cosmetics, the minute quantities of aluminum present in such ingredients are not at risk of absorption, as it these ingredients are insoluble—they are physically incapable of absorption into the body. This is true of such ingredients, whether they are used in cosmetics or skincare/personal care products.</p>, <p>In fact, skin does not readily absorb cosmetic ingredients. It's actually quite challenging to penetrate the skin's outer layers with skincare or medical products—such formulas must be specifically engineered to allow ingredients to penetrate even the most superficial layer of skin.</p>, <p>Thus, aluminum or aluminum ingredients do not contribute to health risks, and a link otherwise has not been established. Quite the opposite, as the Mayo Clinic, The World Health Organization, the European Union and the FDA have all concurred that there is no linkage of aluminum in personal care products to other health risks.</p>, <p>Published literature and an overwhelming amount of research has shown that skin cannot absorb aluminum from these ingredients, and what is used is far less than what we are exposed to daily in the food and water (given aluminum is a natural element that's present all around us—whether we use products with aluminum ingredients or not). </p>]

[<p>Seeing “aroma/flavor” on an ingredient list can be either good or bad. For example, if the aroma or flavor comes from mint or citrus, it can be sensitizing. But if the source is something more innocuous, like vanilla, then it shouldn’t pose a risk.</p>, <p>According to the Personal Care Product Council’s Ingredient Database, “Aroma is a term for ingredient labeling used to identify that a product contains a material or combination of materials normally added to a cosmetic to produce or to mask a particular flavor.” The point to be aware of is what kind of flavor your lips (or skin) are being exposed to—and whether or not the exposure poses a risk of sensitivity. Last, be aware that highly flavored lip products can encourage lip-licking—after all, such products do tend to taste good—but they shouldn’t be eaten, and licking your lips too often can cause or worsen dry lips.</p>]

For this reason, avoid any vitamin C (ascorbic acid) products packaged in jars.</p>, <p><strong>What about using vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and niacinamide in the same product or applied at the same time in separate products? </strong></p>, <p>You might have read or heard that <a href="https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/myths/can-niacinamide-and-vitamin-c-be-used-together.html "><strong>niacinamide and vitamin C shouldn’t be used at the same time</strong></a>, whether found together in the same product or applied separately one after the other. Rest assured, this combination is fine and is in fact quite beneficial! </p>, <p>The research this misconception is based on was conducted in the 1960s; the forms of niacinamide and vitamin C used in this study were not stabilized—although niacinamide itself is very stable. The base of the formula used in this study was also far different than today’s sophisticated skincare formulas.  Today, cosmetic chemists know how to combine niacinamide and vitamin C in the ideal base formulas that enhance their compatibility. </p>, <p>The other common concern we’ve seen about combining these two ingredients has to do with the pH range. The concern is that the acidic environment ascorbic acid needs to be most effective will cause niacinamide will convert to nicotinic acid, a form that can be sensitizing, possibly inducing redness. Good news: This conversion process would only happen under conditions of the formula being exposed to very high heat for a long period of time. This would not apply to layering skincare products or to heat conditions that occur during manufacturing, transport, and storage of cosmetic products that contain niacinamide and ascorbic acid.<br/>  <br/>What all of this means is that you can use or layer products containing both niacinamide and vitamin C knowing that they will not render each other any less effective. Each of these ingredients on its own can help to address dark spots, uneven skin tone, wrinkles, loss of firmness, and dullness. When used together, they become even more of a powerhouse!

[<p>A natural antioxidant and anti-aging ingredient found in the seeds and leaves of the plant <em>Psoralea corylifolia</em>. This plant, also known as babchi, is native to and grows throughout India, where it plays a role in Ayurvedic medicine, and is also found in China (where it’s used in Chinese natural medicine) as well as parts of Africa. Ongoing in vitro (Petri dish) and in vivo (on skin) research has shown that bakuchiol seems to have skin-restoring ability when applied twice daily, and that it may also have a brightening effect on skin. Research has also shown this plant ingredient has soothing and anti-wrinkle properties as well as helping to visibly improve skin color and tone.</p>, <p>Bakuchiol is often touted as an alternative to retinol minus the sensitizing effects some people experience from retinol. The association between bakuchiol and retinol is because many of its benefits seem to mimic what retinol does; however, it’s important to distinguish that bakuchiol is not identical to retinol. It’s not an equivalent replacement any more than a blueberry is the nutritional equivalent of an apple.</p>, <p>Science has revealed that bakuchiol interacts with many of the same areas in skin as retinol, sometimes by taking the same pathway, other times by going a different route but still leading to the same results, such as diminished wrinkles, improved elasticity, and smoother skin. In either case, we’re confident that bakuchiol is a promising, beneficial ingredients whose actions can complement and enhance what retinol does for skin.</p>, <p>Research has confirmed that bakuchiol works best in concentrations between 0.5-2%. Amounts lower than that have not been shown to provide retinol-like benefits.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong></p>, <p><em>Pharmacological Research</em>, March 2019, pages 208-213</p>, <p><em>British Journal of Dermatology</em>, February 2019, pages 253-254</p>, <p><em>Oncotarget</em>, March 2016, pages 14,616-14,627</p>, <p><em>International Journal of Cosmetic Science</em>, June 2014, issue 3, pages 221-230</p>, <p><em>Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry</em>, Volume 74, Issue 7, 2010, pages 1504-1506</p>, <p><em>The American Journal of Chinese Medicine</em>, 2010, pages 105-114</p>, <p><em>Pharmacognosy Review</em>, January-June 2010, pages 68-76</p>]

[<p>Barium sulfate is an inorganic salt that occurs in nature. As a cosmetic ingredient, the synthetic form is used so as to avoid sulfuric acid impurities that can irritate skin. It works to opacify products, such as creams and lotions but is used extensively in non-aqueous makeup products such as lipsticks, blush, and mascaras, as it helps extend the longevity of cosmetic pigments, plus apply its own “coloration” similar to how titanium dioxide adds whiteness.</p>, <p>Barium sulfate may play a role in skin barrier recovery by preventing water loss from skin’s uppermost layers.</p>, <p>In 2018, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Board revisited the safety of barium sulfate as used in cosmetics, where amounts range from 0.99%-37% in either rinse-off or leave-on products. The Board determined barium sulfate is safe and non-sensitizing provided it’s formulated to be non-irritating (meaning the finished ingredient does not contain irritating salts from sulfuric acid). As the synthetic form of barium sulfate is what’s available for use in cosmetics, there is, quite literally, no need to be concerned that it might irritate skin; however, as with any cosmetic ingredient, an individual allergic reaction could still occur (although this is considered rare).</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong></p>]

[<p>Beta hydroxy acid, also known by the acronym BHA, refers to the ingredient salicylic acid. A beta hydroxy acid (BHA) product with salicylic acid exfoliates skin and soothes. It is a multi-benefit ingredient used to improve acne and blackheads.

[<p>A gentle hydrating ingredient that may be plant-derived or synthetic, betaine also naturally occurs in skin and the body.

[<p>Derived from sugar beets, this ingredient is sometimes used as an alternative to the exfoliating ingredient salicylic acid in countries where the usage of salicylic acid is prohibited or the amount permitted is severely restricted. Although betaine salicylate appears to be promising, there’s no independent research to go on, and no independent studies comparing its effectiveness to the well-established BHA ingredient salicylic acid.</p>, <p>The only research about betaine salicylate comes from Arch Personal Care Products, an ingredient manufacturer that sells this ingredient. According to their information based on in vivo testing, betaine salicylate shows comparable effectiveness to salicylic acid at double the concentration. So, in seems that in order to get the same results from betaine salicylate as a product with 2% salicylic acid, a 4% concentration of betaine salicylate is necessary.</p>, <p>Interestingly, like salicylic acid, betaine salicylate’s effectiveness is pH-dependent, with a pH range of 3.8-4.2 being needed.</p>, <p>Anecdotal information from consumers who’ve tried products with betaine salicylate and salicylic acid is mixed; some people report better results and tolerability with betaine salicylate, while others report that salicylic acid worked better, without any unwanted effects. Our advice? Unless you know your skin cannot tolerate or doesn’t respond well to leave-on exfoliants with salicylic acid, there’s little reason to seek out an exfoliant with betaine salicylate. However, if you live in a country where salicylic acid’s use in skincare is unusually restricted, betaine salicylate exfoliants are worth checking out, but be sure the concentration is at least 4%.</p>]

[<p>Term that refers to a sunscreen’s ability to protect the skin from both UVA and UVB rays from the sun. Current FDA regulations state that in order for any SPF-rated product to make a broad spectrum claim, it must pass what's known as a critical wavelength test and have the required testing done to confirm its SPF rating is 15 or greater.

[<p>Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection.</p>, <p>Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body.</p>, <p>However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens.</p>, <p>Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people.</p>, <p>We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help. </p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong><br/> <em>Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology</em>, May 2017, 320-325<br/> <em>Annual Review of Food Science Technology</em>, February 2017, pages 371-390<br/> <em>Journal of Applied Toxicology</em>, April 2017, ePublication<br/> <em>Environmental Science and Technology</em>, April 2017, page 4009-4017<br/> <em>Dermatitis</em>, November-December 2015, pages 254-259<br/> <em>Toxicology Letters</em>, December 2013, pages 295-305<br/> <em>Skin Therapy Letter</em>, July-August 2013, pages 5-7<br/> <em>Journal of Agricultural Food Chemistry</em>, June 2008, pages 4631-4636<br/> <em>International Journal of Toxicology</em>, April 2008, pages 1-82<br/> <a href="http://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/paraben-information" target="_blank">http://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/paraben-information</a><br/>

[<p>Caffeine is the chief stimulant in beverages such as coffee and tea. It’s often included in skincare products with claims that it will improve the look of cellulite or puffy eyes. Unfortunately, research into caffeine’s effects in this regard are mixed.

[<p>One of the components of the <em>Cannabis sativa</em> and <em>Cannabis indica</em> plants. Although listed on a cosmetic product by the approved name of cannabidiol, this ingredient is commonly referred to as <strong><a href="https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/natural-skincare/cbd-oil-benefits-for-skin-can-help-acne-anti-aging.html">CBD</a></strong>. Cannabidiol is one of numerous cannabinoids found primarily in the Cannabis species of plants. It occurs naturally in the flowering tops of the hemp plant (Cannabis sativa) but not in hemp seeds. Products that contain hemp seed oil that tout it as the source of cannabidiol most likely do not contain this substance (especially if you don’t see it listed among the product’s ingredients); however, it is possible to grow CBD-enriched hemp, where meaningful amounts of the cannabidiol is found in multiple parts of the plant. Confusing? Absolutely, which is why it’s important to only purchase CBD skin care from a trusted brand.</p>, <p>Cannabidiol has been shown to offer numerous benefits related to calming skin. Skin has specific receptor sites for cannabinoids (referred to as its endocannabinoid system). It seems CBD can “talk” to these receptor sites on skin, sending unique signals to stop firing the wrong messages, which in turn leads to healthier, better-looking skin. This benefit makes cannabidiol an intriguing ingredient for interrupting the progression of damage within skin’s uppermost layers that can lead to visible problems; however, more research needs to be done to gain a greater understanding of how CBD works on skin.</p>, <p>Research has also shown, though isn’t entirely clear on how this works, that CBD seems to visibly reduce oily skin. It’s also a very good antioxidant, on par with vitamins C and E.</p>, <p>A quick note on the other compound in <em>Cannabis</em> that’s often mentioned, and that’s THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). This is the cannabinoid in marijuana (<em>Cannabis indica</em>) that has psychoactive effects (gets you high). The cannabidiol in skin care products must be THC-free, which means it contains 0.3% or less of this chemical, an amount lawmakers have deemed safe and unable to produce any sort of “high.”</p>, <p>Last, the legal status of <strong><a href="https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/natural-skincare/cbd-oil-benefits-for-skin-can-help-acne-anti-aging.html">CBD in skin care</a></strong> (meaning for topical use only, not ingestion) appears to be on solid footing for now, but it’s a changing landscape that is being examined with an aim on clarifying its usage for consumers.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong></p>, <p>

[<p>Capryloyl salicylic acid is a derivative (ester) of salicylic acid developed by L’Oreal. In chemistry circles, it’s known as 2‐hydroxy‐5‐octanoyl benzoic acid, but skin care consumers most likely know it has lipohydroxy acid (LHA). The “lipo” portion is oil-soluble, although so is regular salicylic acid.</p>, <p>To date, studies haven’t shown capryloyl salicylic acid is superior to salicylic acid; however, we know that LHA has a larger molecular size and along with its fatty acid structure has been shown to penetrate the skin slower than salicylic acid. In vitro studies have shown LHA tends to stay within the stratum corneum (the outermost layers of skin), while salicylic acid penetrates up to 58% further. This limitation may explain why capryloyl salicylic acid is not considered as effective for acne as salicylic acid.</p>, <p>Speaking of acne, there is comparative research showing capryloyl salicylic acid used with benzoyl peroxide and/or a topical antibiotic produced slightly better results than using benzoyl peroxide and the topical antibiotic alone. While that’s encouraging, if you’re struggling with acne, regular salicylic acid should remain your go-to exfoliant.</p>, <p>Just like salicylic acid, the capryloyl derivative has exfoliating and soothing properties as well as documented improvement in skin tone, wrinkles, and clogged pores. It also has the same formulary requirements around the pH range it works best, although unlike salicylic acid, in skin care LHA’s concentration is typically no greater than 1%.</p>, <p>Interestingly, comparative research hasn’t focused on salicylic acid; instead, the single study that exists compared capryloyl salicylic acid to the alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) glycolic acid. In such instances, lower amounts (5-10%) of capryloyl salicylic acid were shown to produce an equivalent to superior level of visible improvement compared with much greater (20-50%) concentrations of glycolic acid. Due to the natural calming properties salicylic acid has, it wasn’t surprising that the LHA peels were perceived as less irritating than the AHA peel.</p>, <p>Capryloyl salicylic acid is generally considered safe when used as directed.</p>, <p><strong>Note:</strong> Although studies on this ingredient were generally well done and followed scientific principles, it’s worth noting that all of them were either done by, funded by, or otherwise supported by L’Oreal. This does not mean the results cannot be counted on, only that there was incentive to cast this ingredient in its best light.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong></p>, <p><em>The Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology</em>, November 2016, pages 40-43<br/> <em>Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology</em>, May 2008, pages 259-262<br/> <em>International Journal of Toxicology</em>, Volume 22, Supplement 3, 2003, pages 1-108<br/> <em>Skin Research and Technology</em>, August 1995, pages 115-122</p>]

[<p>Derived from the fruit portion of the <em>Coffea arabica</em> plant, this ingredient is a very good antioxidant when applied to skin (and consumed orally in the popular beverage coffee). Among other antioxidants, coffee is a rich source of ferulic acid.</p>, <p>On skin, the extract has been shown to reduce the occurrence of destructive enzymes that lead to signs of aging as well as help visibly repair signs of sun damage.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong><br/> <em>Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology</em>, September 2017, pages 323-332<br/> <em>Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity</em>, September 2015, ePublication<br/> <em>Food and Chemical Toxicology</em>, January 2011, pages 309-318<br/> </p>]
[<p>The concentrated oil from the coffee bean plant, which is green, not dark brown as this color doesn't occur until coffee beans are roasted. Research on this oil's effect on skin is intriguing. In vitro tests on skin samples and sections of human skin have shown topical application can help restore skin and contribute to a healthier, smoother look and feel. This non-fragrant plant oil also appears to stimulate pathways in skin that lead to greater moisture retention.</p>, <p>Although that news is encouraging, at this point there's little research to go on. However, coffee seed extract and oil are a rich source of antioxidants whether consumed (as in beverages) or applied to skin. We're hopeful that ongoing research will reveal all forms of coffee to have benefits for skin.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong></p>, <p><em>Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology</em>, March 2009, issue 1, pages 56-62</p>]

[<p>A form of oatmeal used in cosmetics and skincare products. It is produced by finely grinding oats, then boiling them. Research shows avenathramides, potent types of antioxidants found in oats (and colloidal oatmeal), can help soothe skin. A high concentration of beta-glucan and starches in colloidal oatmeal also mean it has water-binding properties and is an effective skin protectant. In fact, the United States Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) categorizes colloidal oatmeal as a skin protectant, allowing it to be listed as an active ingredient on skincare products.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information: </strong></p>, <p>Food and Drug Administration.

[<p>Copper peptides combine the element copper with three amino acids. Copper peptides occur naturally in the body, and is a growing body of research concerning how copper peptides may improve the appearance of multiple signs of aging, but this concerns synthetic, lab-engineered peptides.</p>, <p>Are copper peptides finally the anti-aging answer? No. Although there’s some convincing research demonstrating copper bound with peptides has skin-smoothing benefit, those studies were set up and paid for by companies selling the ingredient complex or selling products that contain it, typically marketed as GHK-copper.<br/><br/>What’s more, these studies rarely, if ever, compare the allegedly wonderful results of copper peptides other, more established ingredients.</p>]

[<p>Non-sensitizing plant extract (also known by its Latin name of <em>Cucumis sativus</em>). Most types of cucumber are composed of 95% water, and the other constituents primarily include ascorbic acid (vitamin C), caffeic acid (an antioxidant), fatty acids, the mineral silica, plus other trace minerals. Due to its antioxidant activity, cucumber is a welcome addition to anti-aging products.</p>, <p>Cucumber contains fragrant components that are not sensitizing to skin (a rarity) so it can be used to enhance the natural scent of a cosmetic product without issue.</p>, <p>While this ingredient is often reported to be useful for improving the appearance of puffy eyes there is not adequate, reliable research to support this contention.</p>, <p>In case you’re wondering: The act of placing slightly chilled cucumber slices over the eye may help reduce puffiness, but that’s not because the cucumber has de-puffing properties. Rather, it’s the coolness of it that diminishes puffiness and constricts the skin, and cucumber slices just happen to fit the contours of the eye area.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong></p>, <p>International Journal of Toxicology, May 2014, pages 47-67</p>, <p><em>Archives of Dermatological Research, </em>May 2011, pages 247-252</p>, <p><em>Natural Product Research</em>, October 2010, pages 1537-1545</p>]

[<p>Also known as DBP, it is a common ingredient in nail polish and most synthetic fragrances sold today. It is used as a plasticizer, fragrance stabilizer, and is a key component in giving nail polish its unique properties. The most common mode of exposure, though, is through foods that come into contact with PVC (polyvinylchloride) plastic packaging. Phthalates are also found in countless other products, including building materials, insecticides, nutritional supplements, children’s toys, and automobiles (Source: <em>International Journal of Andrology</em>, February 2006, pages 181–185). In short, it is impossible to completely avoid exposure to phthalates.</p>, <p>Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) became controversial when The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals—Results for Mono-butyl phthalate [which is] (metabolized from dibutyl phthalate). The report noted that measurable levels of phthalate were found in the urine of the participants in the study. However, the CDC also stated that “Finding a measurable amount of one or more phthalate metabolites in urine does not mean that the level of one or more phthalates causes an adverse health effect. Whether phthalates at the levels of metabolites reported here are a cause for health concern is not yet known; more research is needed."</p>, <p>Despite the negative association phthalate exposure has in animals, an analysis of multiple studies and epidemiologic research led to the conclusion that “...the risks are low, even lower than originally thought, and that there is no convincing evidence of adverse effects on humans. Since the scientific evidence strongly suggests that risks to humans are low, phthalate regulations that have been enacted are unlikely to lead to any marked improvement in public health.”</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong></p>, <p><em>Food Additives and Contaminants</em>, November 2010, pages 1608–1611,1616</p>, <p><em>Risk Analysis</em>, August 2009, issue 8 pages 1170­-1181</p>, <p><em>Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health</em>, February 2009, pages 157­–174</p>, <p><em>Environmental Health Perspectives</em>, December 2000, volume 108, issue 12</p>]

[<p>DMAE, also known as dimethyl MEA, is a derivative of the B vitamin choline. It has been around for years as an oral supplement that's popularly believed to improve mental alertness, much like Ginkgo biloba and coenzyme Q10. However, the research about DMAE does not show the same positive results as the other two supplements. </p>, <p>Because DMAE is chemically similar to choline, DMAE is thought to stimulate production of acetylcholine. And because acetylcholine is a brain neurotransmitter, it's easy to see how it could be associated with brain function. However, only a handful of studies have looked at DMAE for that purpose and they have not been conclusive in the least, while some have shown that DMAE may be problematic or not very effective.</p>, <p>It’s a controversial ingredient for skin because research has shown conflicting results. It seems to offer an initial benefit that improves skin firmness, but these results are short-lived and eventually give way to destruction of the substances in skin that help keep it firm. DMAE may also have skin-calming effects.</p>, <p>Interestingly, there is a formulation challenge when including DMAE in skincare products. To maintain the efficacy and stability of DMAE, the product’s pH level must be at least 10. A pH of 10 is highly alkaline, which isn’t good news for skin. </p>, <p>Moreover, because almost all moisturizers (including serums and eye creams) are formulated with a pH that closely matches that of human skin (generally 5.5–6.5, which is on the acidic side of the scale), in all likelihood the DMAE included in skincare products cannot have any prolonged functionality.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong></p>, <p><em>Pharmazie</em>, December 2009, pages 818-822</p>, <p><em>Journal of Drugs in Dermatology</em>, Supplement 72, 2008, pages S17–S22</p>, <p><em>Aesthetic Plastic Surgery</em>, November-December 2007, pages 711–718</p>, <p><em>British Journal of Dermatology</em>, March 2007, pages 433-439</p>, <p><em>American Journal of Clinical Dermatology</em>, Volume 6, 2005, pages 39–47</p>, <p><em>European Journal of Medical Research</em>, May 2003, pages 183–191</p>, <p><em>Mechanisms of Aging and Development</em>, February 1988, pages 129–138</p>]

[<p>Also known as phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid, ensulizole is a water soluble sunscreen ingredient that works in the UVB range, offering no UVA protection. For this reason, ensulizole should always be paired with one or more UVA-screening sunscreen actives in any SPF-rated product labeled “broad spectrum”.</p>, <p>There’s some controversy in the research about what some refer to as ensulizole potentially being a “double-edged sword” for skin. Studies on fish scales and bat skin have shown it protects against oxidizing molecules generated by UVB exposure but it can also trigger DNA damage within skin. Although this hasn’t shown to be true on human skin, it may at least partially explain why ensulizole is not commonly found in sunscreens, despite having very few reports of triggering allergic reactions on human skin.</p>, <p>Aesthetically, ensulizole feels lighter and less oily than most synthetic sunscreen actives, so is sometimes chosen when the goal is a very lightweight texture, although the mineral actives titanium dioxide and zinc oxide can also feel surprisingly light on skin.</p>, <p>Ensulizole concentrations up to 4% are approved for use in sunscreens sold in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea. In most other parts of the world, ensulizole concentrations up to 8% are permitted, with the exception of Japan, whose maximum permitted amount is 3%.</p>, <p>Along with protecting skin from UVB damage, ensulizole or its salts are sometimes included in cosmetics whose clear packaging would otherwise allow the formula inside to discolor due to ongoing light exposure. Salt forms of ensulizole include potassium phenylbenzimidazole sulfonate, sodium phenylbenzimidazole sulfonate and TEA-phenylbenzimidazole sulfonate.</p>, <p>This sunscreen active is one of several currently undergoing further safety testing under the purview of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This testing is to gain a better understanding of the systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination of these sunscreen actives when small amounts enter the body via topical use. It’s important to know that the presence of this or other sunscreen actives in the body does not mean your health is at risk. It is anticipated that the additional testing being done will reaffirm the safety of these ingredients; however, those who remain concerned can choose sunscreens with mineral actives (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) which are not included in the FDA’s new call for additional testing.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information</strong></p>, <p><em>Contact Dermatitis</em>, August 2019, pages 151-152<br/> <em>Journal of Investigative Dermatology</em>, October 2010, pages 2,463–2,471<br/> Shaath, Nadim A., The Encyclopedia of Ultraviolet Filters, Allured Publishing, 2007, pages 162–163<br/> https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=352.10&amp;SearchTerm=phenylbenzimidazole%20sulfonic%20acid%20<br/> <em>Photochemistry &amp; Photobiology</em>, February 2002, pages 107–116</p>]

[<p>Occurrence that takes place at an atomic level and is a complex physiological process. Molecules are comprised of atoms. Atoms comprise all matter. Atoms are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Electrons occur in pairs, and when an element only has a few paired electrons it can easily become unstable.</p>, <p>Oxygen and oxides are primary examples of potential unstable elements in our environment. When oxygen interacts with skin (and because the air we breathe is 20% oxygen, that happens all the time), it almost always loses one of its electrons. This oxygen molecule, which now is minus one electron, is a damaging environmental factor.</p>, <p>Because it is now unstable, the oxygen molecule quickly finds another electron, and it does this by taking an electron from another molecule in the skin, which is usually a healthy substance such as antioxidants in the skin. Antioxidants have lots of electrons to spare. Once those substances are robbed of all their electrons they break down and are destroyed. Oxygen molecules (or other potentially damaging environmental factors) attempting to replenish themselves in this way trigger a cascading event. The reactions that cause environmental damage take place in mere fractions of a second. Antioxidants are substances that prevent oxidative damage from beginning.</p>, <p></p>, <p>The primary causes of environmental damage on skin are pollution, air, cigarette smoke, herbicides, and solvents (such as alcohol). Antioxidants are a way to potentially neutralize these effects via topical application.</p>]

[<p>Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection.</p>, <p>Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body.</p>, <p>However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens.</p>, <p>Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people.</p>, <p>We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help. </p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong><br/> <em>Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology</em>, May 2017, 320-325<br/> <em>Annual Review of Food Science Technology</em>, February 2017, pages 371-390<br/> <em>Journal of Applied Toxicology</em>, April 2017, ePublication<br/> <em>Environmental Science and Technology</em>, April 2017, page 4009-4017<br/> <em>Dermatitis</em>, November-December 2015, pages 254-259<br/> <em>Toxicology Letters</em>, December 2013, pages 295-305<br/> <em>Skin Therapy Letter</em>, July-August 2013, pages 5-7<br/> <em>Journal of Agricultural Food Chemistry</em>, June 2008, pages 4631-4636<br/> <em>International Journal of Toxicology</em>, April 2008, pages 1-82<br/> <a href="http://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/paraben-information" target="_blank">http://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/paraben-information</a><br/>

[<p>General term for any color additive deemed safe and FDA-approved for use in foods, drugs, and cosmetics. When an FD&amp;C color is followed by the word “lake,” it means the color has been mixed with a mineral (most commonly calcium or aluminum) to make the color insoluble (not affected by water). For example, “FD&amp;C Blue No. 1–Aluminum Lake” means that the color FD&amp;C Blue No. 1 has been combined with aluminum. Lake colors are used for candies and for dyes used to color Easter eggs, among countless cosmetics applications.</p>, <p>The current group of FD&amp;C colors has been extensively studied, with many classified as “permanently approved” for use in drugs and foods. Some FD&amp;C colors, such as Blue 1 and Blue 2, are derivatives of coal tar and can cause allergic reactions, although the amounts used in items such as lipsticks typically are lower than the amounts used for other types of coloring agents. No coal tar colors are permitted in products for use around the eyes, and every batch of coal tar color must be deemed safe before it can be used in foods, drugs, or cosmetics.</p>, <p>Any coloring agent used in eye makeup must be specifically approved for that purpose by the FDA.</p>, <p>The color of cosmetics products is often an emotional pull for many consumers. A soft pink lotion can denote a moisturizer meant to calm or soothe skin, while a bright yellow balm may be deemed energizing. Whether natural or synthetic, coloring agents in skincare products serve no purpose other than to create a perception or an emotional response to the product. Coloring agents used in makeup are a different story, as they’re used to create an endless kaleidoscope of shades.</p>, <p><strong>Reference for this information:</strong></p>, <p>U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

[<p>Fig may seem like a simple fruit often associated with the soft-textured cookies sold in grocery stores; however, it is proving to be a rather fascinating ingredient for skin.</p>, <p>It’s a rich source of a class of antioxidants known as phenolic compounds, including gallic acid, various epicatechins, and anthocyanins which contribute to the rich, often dark color of fig skin and the fruit inside.</p>, <p>Along with being an antioxidant, fig has been shown to enhance skin’s hydration by preventing water loss from skin’s uppermost layers. It can also visibly improve skin color by addressing an enzyme in skin (tyrosinase) whose overproduction can lead to dark spots.</p>, <p>Those benefits are intriguing, but there’s more: fig extract has also been to help reduce uncomfortably dry, tight skin, including compromised, redness-prone skin.</p>, <p>One caution: Fig contains a group of naturally-occurring compounds known as psoralens. These can make skin more sensitive to sun exposure, but you can get around this by using a broad spectrum sunscreen every day.

[<p>According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the term "flavor" on a product label signifies "any natural or synthetic substance or substances used solely to impart a taste to a cosmetic product." In Europe, the labeling name for flavor is "aroma". The term "flavor" is used most often for lip-care products and lip cosmetics (think lipstick, lip gloss).</p>, <p>Although it is basically synonomous with fragrance, listing "flavor" on products meant for application to lips is more appealing (who wants to think of ingesting fragrance?). Given that flavor can be composed of numerous ingredients, it's a gamble as to whether or not lips will experience sensitivity.

[<p>Gluten is a protein that occurs naturally in many types of grains, including wheat, rye, and barley. As a general group, gluten ingredients include several grains or grain-derived ingredients that are potentially problematic for those diagnosed with a health condition that interferes with the normal digestion of glutens. In this instance, eating gluten-containing foods is ill-advised.</p>, <p>The question is whether those with such a health condition or dietary sensitivity should avoid gluten ingredients in cosmetics, and the answer is no. That’s because gluten ingredients cannot get past the skin’s uppermost layers and enter the body (specifically, the digestive system) where they can be troublesome for those with a gluten intolerance. Gluten is simply too big to get into the body via topical application. </p>, <p>The exception is applying gluten-containing products to lips, as in these instances some amount of ingestion occurs. Therefore, you’d want to avoid lip balm, gloss, or lipstick/lip color products that contain gluten ingredients.</p>, <p>Of course, if you have an allergy to gluten ingredients you’d want to check with your health care provider to determine if the allergy is limited to oral consumption or also includes topical application (assuming you haven’t already determined that topical application of gluten ingredients is a problem for you).</p>, <p>If you have a known sensitivity to gluten, avoid products that contain wheat and its derivatives, malt, barley, rye, wheat germ, and oat ingredients.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong></p>, <p><em>Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics</em>, September 2012, pages 1,316-1,323<br/>

[<p>Also called glycerol or glycerine, glycerin is a humectant that’s present in all natural lipids (fats), whether animal or vegetable. It can be derived from natural substances by hydrolysis of fats and by fermentation of sugars; it also can be synthetically manufactured, which is usually the case with modern-day skincare products.</p>, <p>Glycerin is a <a href="https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/anti-aging-wrinkles/skin-replenishing.html"><strong>skin-replenishing</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/anti-aging-wrinkles/skin-restoring.html"><strong>skin-restoring</strong></a> ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration. It’s one of the many substances in skin that helps maintain a healthy look and feel, defending against dryness and working to maintain skin’s moisture level. Essentially, <a href="https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/best-products/benefits-glycerin-skincare.html"><strong>glycerin is a master at hydration</strong></a>, and works best when combined with other replenishing and emollient ingredients.</p>, <p>Some people wonder whether using products with glycerin takes too much water from skin when there isn’t enough humidity in the air. This can occur with pure glycerin (100% concentration—an amount that’s never used in skincare products). Any humectant (including glycerin) used in pure form can increase water loss by attracting water from the lower layers of skin into the surface layers when the climate is too arid (low humidity). For this reason, glycerin and humectants are typically used in concentrations of 5% or less and always combined with other ingredients to soften skin. In fact, glycerin combined with other emollients and/or oils is a fundamental cornerstone of most moisturizers.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong><br/> <em>International Journal of Cosmetic Science</em>, August 2016, ePublication<br/> <em>British Journal of Dermatology</em>, July 2008, pages 23-34<br/> <em>Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology</em>, June 2007, pages 75-82<br/> <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, June 2003, pages 7,360-7,365<br/> </p>]

Often hyped as a special kind of honey, it’s produced in New Zealand from bees that pollinate the country’s native Manuka shrub. Manuka honey is similar to “regular” clover honey except it’s said to contain more of a chemical called methylglyoxal, which might give manuka honey an advantage. Some research shows that it doesn’t necessarily have an edge over other varieties for calming properties and wound healing such as acacia and buckwheat honey.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong><br/> <em>Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy</em>, August 2017, pages 849-855<br/> <em>The Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews</em>, March 2015, ePublication<br/> <em>Foods</em>, July 2014, pages 420-432<br/> <em>PeerJ.</em>, March 2014, eCollection, 2014<br/> <em>Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology</em>, December 2013, pages 306-313<br/> <em>Burns &amp; Trauma</em>, June 2013, pages 32-38<br/> <em>The Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine</em>, April 2011, pages 154-160<br/>

[<p>Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection.</p>, <p>Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body.</p>, <p>However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens.</p>, <p>Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people.</p>, <p>We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help. </p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong><br/> <em>Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology</em>, May 2017, 320-325<br/> <em>Annual Review of Food Science Technology</em>, February 2017, pages 371-390<br/> <em>Journal of Applied Toxicology</em>, April 2017, ePublication<br/> <em>Environmental Science and Technology</em>, April 2017, page 4009-4017<br/> <em>Dermatitis</em>, November-December 2015, pages 254-259<br/> <em>Toxicology Letters</em>, December 2013, pages 295-305<br/> <em>Skin Therapy Letter</em>, July-August 2013, pages 5-7<br/> <em>Journal of Agricultural Food Chemistry</em>, June 2008, pages 4631-4636<br/> <em>International Journal of Toxicology</em>, April 2008, pages 1-82<br/> <a href="http://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/paraben-information" target="_blank">http://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/paraben-information</a><br/>

[<p><em>Limnanthes alba</em> (meadowfoam) seed oil is a non-fragrant, edible plant oil originally developed as an agricultural crop in the 1950s. It functions as an emollient and softening agent in skin care and hair care products.</p>, <p>This plant oil is exceedingly stable because it is primarily composed of long chain fatty acids, the type most resistant to rancidity when exposed to oxygen. Among plant oils, meadowfoam has the highest concentration (95%) of these highly stable fatty acids, making it a valuable addition to products that would otherwise be prone to spoiling quickly.</p>, <p>Meadowfoam seed oil contains two compounds known as glucosinolate derivatives, 3-methoxybenzyl isothiocyanate (MBITC) and 3-methoxyphenyl acetonitrile. Research has shown these compounds can inhibit collagen-degrading enzymes in skin and help offset the negative impact of UVB light exposure (but just to be clear, these ingredients do not replace the need for broad spectrum sunscreen).</p>, <p>The glucosinolate derivatives are not direct antioxidants (indeed, meadowfoam seed oil isn’t a good source of antioxidants), but they can positively influence skin’s own antioxidant defenses, which is a nice benefit.</p>, <p>Meadowfoam seed oil can also enhance the penetration of other ingredients into soil and across animal skin; however, to date the same benefit hasn’t been shown to occur on human skin. On the upside, the long-chain fatty acids in this plant oil have chemical similarity to some of the fatty acids found in skin’s own oil, so in theory it’s certainly possible meadowfoam oil would help deliver other oil-based (lipophilic) ingredients to skin.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong></p>]

[<p>Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection.</p>, <p>Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body.</p>, <p>However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens.</p>, <p>Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people.</p>, <p>We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet.

[<p>Also known as vitamin B3 and nicotinic acid, niacinamide is a very effective skin-restoring ingredient that offers multiple benefits for aging and blemish-prone skin. Among these benefits is <a href="https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/anti-aging-wrinkles/how-niacinamide-helps-skin.html"><strong>the ability to visibly improve the appearance of enlarged pores, uneven skin tone, fine lines, dullness, and a weakened skin surface</strong></a>. Niacinamide can also mitigate and to some extent help visibly repair damage from UV light and offset other sources of environmental attack, including the negative impact of various types of airborne pollutants. Unlike many beneficial ingredients, niacinamide is stable in the presence of heat and light.</p>, <p><strong>What about using vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and niacinamide in the same product or applied at the same time in separate products? </strong></p>, <p>You might have read or heard that niacinamide and vitamin C shouldn’t be used at the same time, whether found together in the same product or applied separately one after the other. Rest assured, this combination is fine and is in fact quite beneficial! </p>, <p>The research this misconception is based on was conducted in the 1960s; the forms of niacinamide and vitamin C used in this study were not stabilized—although niacinamide itself is very stable. The base of the formula used in this study was also far different than today’s sophisticated skincare formulas. Today, cosmetic chemists know how to combine niacinamide and vitamin C in the ideal base formulas that enhance their compatibility. </p>, <p>The other common concern we’ve seen about combining these two ingredients has to do with the pH range. The concern is that the acidic environment ascorbic acid needs to be most effective will cause niacinamide will convert to nicotinic acid, a form that can be sensitizing, possibly inducing redness. Good news: This conversion process would only happen under conditions of the formula being exposed to very high heat for a long period of time. This would not apply to layering skincare products or to heat conditions that occur during manufacturing, transport, and storage of cosmetic products that contain niacinamide and ascorbic acid.</p>, <p>What all of this means is that you can use or layer products containing both niacinamide and vitamin C knowing that they will not render each other any less effective. Each of these ingredients on its own can help to address dark spots, uneven skin tone, wrinkles, loss of firmness, and dullness. When used together, they become even more of a powerhouse! This duo will help give you an even better chance at achieving a radiant, smooth, even, younger-looking complexion.

The research on this juice and its alleged health effects is considered “very preliminary” or “questionable,” and has yet to be supported by large-scale studies. Its primary benefit for skin, like that of most plants, is as a source of antioxidants. However, there are dozens and dozens of antioxidants with significant research on their benefits for skin, whereas very little exists for morinda.

[<p>Also known as octyl methoxycinnamate and ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, octinoxate is the oldest and most common sunscreen active used to protect skin, primarily against UVB rays. Although octinoxate does provide some UVA protection, it does not protect against the entire range of UVA wavelengths; therefore, there should be another UVA-protecting active present in any sunscreen you use.</p>, <p>Octinoxate has a solid record of safety (decades of research and thousands of studies establishing its safety in sunscreens as indisputable). There are no studies that demonstrate octinoxate, when and as used in SPF products, is harmful. In the sole studies cited when such claims are made, the conditions are completely inapplicable to how sunscreen ingredients are used in skincare products. For example, such “studies” use extremely high concentrations of octinoxate (much higher than would ever be used in sunscreens) or even fed to lab animals. </p>, <p>There simply isn’t any research backing the claim that octinoxate has any link to health risks when used in sunscreen formulas. In fact, the European Union’s permitted usage level for octinoxate in sunscreens is higher than the maximum amount permitted in the United States (7.5% in the United States, 10% in the EU).</p>, <p>This sunscreen active is one of several currently undergoing further safety testing under the purview of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This testing is to gain a better understanding of the systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination of these sunscreen actives when small amounts enter the body via topical use. It’s important to know that the presence of this or other sunscreen actives in the body does not mean your health is at risk. It is anticipated that the additional testing being done will reaffirm the safety of these ingredients; however, those who remain concerned can choose sunscreens with mineral actives (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) which are not included in the FDA’s new call for additional testing.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong></p>, <p><em>Pharmazie</em>, 2013, issue 1, pages 34-40</p>, <p><em>Skin Pharmacology and Physiology</em>, 2005, issue 4, pages170-174</p>]

[<p>Oleic acid is a natural, monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid that’s found in many plants, including grape seed, olives, and sea buckthorn. It’s the primary fatty acid in olive oil, and believed to play a role in this oil’s cholesterol-lowering benefits when consumed orally.</p>, <p>Interestingly, research has shown that topical application of oleic acid on its own or as olive oil can disrupt skin’s barrier; however, this effect was not observed when oleic acid was blended with other fatty acids and skin-beneficial ingredients. On the upside, this kind of barrier disruption can enhance penetration of other ingredients naturally present in plant oils or in the product, so it’s not necessarily all bad (and, as we mentioned, not bad at all unless you’re applying pure oleic acid or straight olive oil to skin).</p>, <p>In another interesting twist, combining oleic acid with other lipids (fats) boosts its skin-calming ability, thus making oleic acid useful for reducing signs of dryness and sensitivity.</p>, <p>In cosmetics, oleic acid is used as a cleansing agent and texture enhancer. It’s among the more stable fatty acids, and has a unique ability to preserve the effectiveness of more delicate ingredients such as antioxidants by helping to protect them from light and air degradation.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong></p>]

Its safety in sunscreens is well established.</p>, <p>As a group, the benzophenones are used not only for sun protection but also as photostabilizers in cosmetics products. That means they keep products from turning color or from degrading in the presence of sunlight. They also have other uses, including flavor enhancers in food.</p>, <p>Oxybenzone is sometimes called out as a sunscreen active that is damaging to undersea coral reefs, the theory being that the sunscreen gets into the water from human activity in the oceans. However, despite research showing oxybenzone negatively impacts coral components in vitro (meaning in a lab setting), there doesn’t seem to be conclusive causation in a marine environment, especially given the numerous other factors, including climate change, believed to be responsible for the loss of coral reefs.</p>, <p>The Personal Care Products Council looked at the research and concluded the following: “Degradation of the world’s coral reefs is a serious concern. According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Coral Reef Conservation Program, coral reefs are threatened by an increasing array of impacts – primarily from global climate change, unsustainable fishing and other factors. There is no scientific evidence that under naturally-occurring conditions, sunscreen ingredients, which have been safely used around the world for decades, are contributing to this issue.”</p>, <p>This sunscreen active is one of several currently undergoing further safety testing under the purview of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

[<p>Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plant’s own protection.</p>, <p>Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body.</p>, <p>However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens.</p>, <p>Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or that they are found naturally in plants, so either source could have been the origin, not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects, but those were done in vitro (meaning in a petri dish) or, again, they were animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people.</p>, <p>We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help. </p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong><br/> <em>Dermatitis</em>, January/February 2019, pages 32-45<br/><em>Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology</em>, May 2017, 320-325<br/> <em>Annual Review of Food Science Technology</em>, February 2017, pages 371-390<br/> <em>Journal of Applied Toxicology</em>, April 2017, ePublication<br/> <em>Environmental Science and Technology</em>, April 2017, page 4009-4017<br/> <em>Dermatitis</em>, November-December 2015, pages 254-259<br/> <em>Toxicology Letters</em>, December 2013, pages 295-305<br/> <em>Skin Therapy Letter</em>, July-August 2013, pages 5-7<br/> <em>Journal of Agricultural Food Chemistry</em>, June 2008, pages 4631-4636<br/> <em>International Journal of Toxicology</em>, April 2008, pages 1-82<br/> <a href="http://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/paraben-information" target="_blank">http://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/paraben-information</a><br/>

[<p>PEG is an acronym for <strong>polyethylene glycol</strong>, an amazingly versatile ingredient in skin care products because of the many uses it has and its broad compatibility with different types of ingredients. PEG is often mixed with an array of hydrating emollients, beneficial fatty acids, and cleansing agents. In these various combinations, a PEG can be used in gentle cleansers, elegant moisturizers, sunscreens, and unique treatment products.</p>, <p>The safety of PEG in its various forms has recently been questioned. The primary concern is that they can contain problematic impurities such as ethylene oxide and 1,4 dioxane. Both of these are by-products from the manufacturing process, not something natural to any form of PEG. Although this was once a concern, reputable cosmetic ingredient suppliers have long since eliminated these impurities from the finished ingredient, which makes PEGs safe for skin.</p>, <p>What is most notable about the various forms of PEG studied to date is they have been shown to be non-irritating for skin or eyes, even when used in concentrations greater than what most skin care products contain. PEGs also widely considered non-toxic because they do not penetrate intact skin. However, as is true for even the gentlest ingredients, when skin is inflamed or compromised, the risk of irritation is increased.</p>, <p>If you’ve seen conflicting information about PEG ingredients, it’s important to know that the conclusions were not applicable to how PEGs are used in skin care products. These studies involved feeding a large amount of PEG to animals or applying very high doses (literally hundreds of magnitudes greater than what is used in topical products) to mouse skin.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong></p>]

[<p>Peptides are portions of short or long-chain amino acids, and amino acids are the building blocks of protein.

Further, because peptides are vulnerable to attack by enzymes, the abundant enzymes present in skin can break the peptides down to the point where they have no effect. Knowledge of these inherent weaknesses has led many ingredient manufacturing companies to produce synthetic peptides engineered to be more stable on and within skin. Such peptides can survive intact on skin and better reach their target areas—so you’ll see anti-aging benefits!</p>, <p>Some peptides have demonstrated a remarkable skin-soothing effect, while others can improve the appearance of wrinkles, loss of firmness, and even help to soften the look of expression lines.</p>, <p>Don’t get seduced by the notion that there’s a best peptide or peptide blend because there isn’t.

Parabens were made evil in skincare products because of studies showing they are endocrine disruptors, but parabens don’t have that property when they absorb into skin. Much like parabens, phenoxyethanol being a problem in cosmetics is based on research that has nothing to do with skincare. The negative research about phenoxyethanol is not about the cosmetics-grade version. That’s a big difference. Even plant extracts have to be purified when they are removed from the ground and put into skincare products. No one wants worms, fertilizer, heavy metals, and dirt in their products. Phenoxyethanol is the same situation, it is purified before it is used in cosmetic formulations.</p>, <p>As with many cosmetic ingredients, concentration matters. A 100% concentration of phenoxyethanol comes with some scary warnings. For example, the Safety Data Sheet on this preservative describes it as harmful if it contacts skin, is inhaled, or gets in to the eyes. Animal studies have shown it causes reproductive and developmental toxicity—no wonder some panic is occurring! As it turns out, the animal studies were about mice being fed large doses of this preservative, not about it being applied to skin, absorbing, and then causing reproductive or developmental harm. If you fed mice mass amounts of lavender or other essential oils, they would suffer terrible consequences.</p>, <p>The rest of the alarming studies are about using phenoxyethanol in full-strength or atypically high concentrations, not the amounts of 1% or less used in cosmetic products. Think of it as the difference between taking one sip of wine versus chugging several bottles at once!</p>, <p>Back to topical use, research has shown that compared to many other preservatives, the incidence of a sensitized or allergic reaction to phenoxyethanol applied as used in cosmetics is rare. But the truth is all preservatives, even the natural ones, carry some risk of sensitizing skin. That’s because preservatives of any kind are meant to kill fungus, bacteria, and mold and that can negatively impact skin. Ironically, in order for natural preservatives to be effective, they have to be used in much higher amounts than synthetic preservatives, typically up to 10%. This higher amount poses irritation and sensitizing problems for skin, so natural preservatives aren’t a slam-dunk replacement for synthetics, not even close.</p>, <p>An interesting factoid: although the phenoxyethanol used in skincare products is synthetic, this chemical occurs naturally in green tea, just like parabens occur naturally in berries and other natural foods.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong></p>, <p><em>Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology</em>, December 2016, page 156</p>, <p><em>PLOS One</em>, October 2016, ePublication</p>, <p><em>Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology</em>, June 2015, pages 1,071-1,081</p>, <p><em>Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries</em>, 2014, issue 5, pages 24-27</p>, <p><em>International Journal of Cosmetic Science</em>, April 2011, issue 2, pages 190-196</p>]

At the end of the study, it was determined that the women’s uneveness decreased by 43%.</p>, <p>The problem is we don’t know how much of this improvement is due to phenylethyl resorcinol, as it wasn’t used alone, which is the case with most products using this ingredient as a means to improve the appearance of an uneven skin tone.

[<p>Phthalates refers to a wide range of substances that are very different from one another. Some are considered safe, and others are considered to pose a potential risk.

[<p>Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection.</p>, <p>Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body.</p>, <p>However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens.</p>, <p>Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people.</p>, <p>We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help. </p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong><br/> <em>Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology</em>, May 2017, 320-325<br/> <em>Annual Review of Food Science Technology</em>, February 2017, pages 371-390<br/> <em>Journal of Applied Toxicology</em>, April 2017, ePublication<br/> <em>Environmental Science and Technology</em>, April 2017, page 4009-4017<br/> <em>Dermatitis</em>, November-December 2015, pages 254-259<br/> <em>Toxicology Letters</em>, December 2013, pages 295-305<br/> <em>Skin Therapy Letter</em>, July-August 2013, pages 5-7<br/> <em>Journal of Agricultural Food Chemistry</em>, June 2008, pages 4631-4636<br/> <em>International Journal of Toxicology</em>, April 2008, pages 1-82<br/> <a href="http://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/paraben-information" target="_blank">http://www.cosmeticsinfo.org/paraben-information</a><br/>

[<p>Name for the entire vitamin A molecule. Retinol is a powerhouse ingredient that has value for skin on several fronts: It’s a skin-restoring, wrinkle-smoothing, firming ingredient and an antioxidant, allowing it to improve a variety of skin concerns, most related to visible signs of aging.</p>, <p>Packaging is a key issue, so any container that lets in air (like jar packaging) or sunlight (clear containers) just won’t cut it. Lots of retinol products come in unacceptable packaging; these should be avoided because the retinol will most likely be (or quickly become) ineffective. Look for opaque, airless, or air-restrictive packaging.</p>, <p>Many consumers are concerned about the percentage of retinol in anti-aging products such as serums or moisturizers. Although the percentage can make a difference (especially if it’s too low), it’s not helpful in understanding how a retinol product will benefit your skin. Far more important is the delivery system, packaging, and the other ingredients present with the retinol. </p>, <p>Using a product with a range of anti-aging ingredients plus retinol is far more valuable for skin than using a product with only a supposedly high percentage of retinol.

[<p>Combination of retinol (pure vitamin A) and the fatty acid palmitic acid. Research has shown it to be an effective antioxidant when applied to skin.

[<p>Synthetic, “new generation” retinol with research showing its usefulness for restoring and improving signs of aging in skin. Retinyl retinoate has been shown, in limited but promising research (most coming from the same team of Korea-based researchers), to be less sensitizing than retinoic acid (prescription-strength) and cosmetic retinol. Retinyl retinoate may be less sensitizing than pure retinol because of its slower conversion in skin to retinoic acid. However, when it comes to sensitivity from retinol, there’s much that can be done using time-release delivery systems and ingredient additions to maximize its benefits to skin while minimizing, if not eliminating, its risk of sensitivity.</p>, <p>Although there’s reason to consider retinyl retinoate if your skin seems intolerant of cosmetic retinol, it shouldn’t be construed as better or safer for skin than such alternatives.</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong></p>, <p><em>Dermatology Research and Practice</em>, 2010</p>, <p><em>Cutis</em>, October 2008, issue 4, pages 281-284</p>, <p>The Chemistry and Manufacture of Cosmetics.

[<p>Substance derived from silica (sand is a silica). The unique fluid properties of silicone give it a great deal of slip, and in its various forms it can feel like silk on skin, impart emollience, and be a water-binding agent that holds up well, even when skin becomes wet. The research about silicones have proven them to be superior scar-healing ingredients, soothing agents, non-irritating, and uniquely effective delivery and suspending agents for a wide range of cosmetic ingredients.</p>, <p>There are numerous forms of silicones used in cosmetic products, particularly leave-on skincare products and all manner of hair-care products. Common forms of silicone are cyclopentasiloxane and cyclohexasiloxane; other forms include various types of dimethicone and phenyl trimethicone.</p>, <p>Claims that silicones in any form cause or worsen skin concerns have not been substantiated in any published research, nor have reports that silicones are sensitizing to or somehow “suffocate” skin. In fact, just the opposite is true which makes the misinformation difficult to understand. Almost all of the claims about silicones being problematic for skin are apparently myths or based on anecdotal evidence.</p>, <p>Because of silicone’s unique molecular properties, they are at the same time porous and resistant though not impermeable to air. Think of silicones in a skincare formula like the covering of a tea bag. When you steep the tea bag in water the tea and all of its antioxidant properties are released into the water. Silicones remain on the surface of your skin and the other ingredients it’s mixed with “steep” through. All ingredients must be suspended in some base formula; some of the ingredients remain on the surface, some are absorbed. The intent is for the “actives” to get through. The special molecular structure of silicones (large molecules with wide spaces between each molecule) allows them to form a permeable barrier and also explains why silicones rarely feel heavy or occlusive, although they still offer protection against moisture loss.</p>, <p>Interestingly, silicone has been shown to be helpful for offsetting dryness and flaking from common ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide.</p>, <p>Bottom line: The types of silicones used in cosmetic products are supported by scientific research and are considered safe for consumer use.

[<p><em>Spiraea ulmaria</em> extract, commonly known as meadowsweet, is a plant whose various parts have been shown to calm factors in skin that lead to signs of irritation. Antioxidants flavonoids and phenolic acids in meadowsweet such as flavonoids rutoside, spiraeoside, and isoquercitrin are believed to be the key contributors to this benefit.</p>, <p><em>Spiraea ulmaria</em> is also a natural source of salicylates such as salicin, and is sometimes claimed to be a natural source of the exfoliating ingredient salicylic acid. But it doesn’t work like salicylic acid on skin because the salicylates require the digestive system to become salicylic acid--this process doesn’t happen on skin, but these compounds share salicylic acid’s redness-calming benefits.</p>, <p>This plant extract seems to inhibit an enzyme in skin (5-alpha reductase) that can trigger excess oil production.

[<p>Ingredients like sugarcane extract, fruit extracts, mixed fruit extracts, and milk solids may claim an association with AHAs, but they are not the same thing nor do they have the same beneficial effect on skin. While glycolic acid can indeed be derived from sugarcane, if you assume that sugarcane will net you the same result as glycolic acid, that would be like assuming you could write on a tree the way you can write on paper.</p>, <p>Wood is certainly where paper begins, but paper wouldn’t exist if the wood didn’t undergo complex mechanical and chemical processes.

[<p>In cosmetics, this large group of ingredients is used mainly as cleansing agents in skincare and hair-care products; they include sodium lauryl sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate, and sodium laureth sulfate. Many consumers are concerned of sulfates in their cosmetics products because of widespread misinformation. Sulfates are not a problem, but once organizations and companies build up fears among consumers about certain cosmetics ingredients there’s almost no going back, the damage is done.</p>, <p>In reality there’s absolutely no research showing that sulfates are a problem in skincare or hair-care products, other than causing sensitivity, but that is also true for the sulfate-free cleansing agents that some cosmetics companies advertise and sell. And, whether or not a cleansing agent will cause sensitivity depends on the amount of sulfate and on other ingredients present in a specific formula.</p>, <p>Following are some of the most typical unsupported comments about sulfates: “Sulfate-free shampoos and cleansers are better for hair and skin.” No research has shown that to be even remotely the case. Sulfates are supposed to be terribly drying and damaging to hair, when in fact they function no differently from the cleansing agents in sulfate-free shampoos. Almost every company that touts the fact that they don’t contain sulfates do use detergent cleansing agents such as sodium lauryl sulfoacetate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, cocamidopropylamine oxide, and sodium methyl 2-sulfolaurate.</p>, <p>Why those are supposedly any better for skin is never explained, and no research is ever cited—because none exists. Sometimes these companies list those ingredients as being derived from or coming from coconut to make them sound natural and, by association, better for skin—but they all end up being primarily synthetic. That doesn’t make them bad in any way; it’s just that the claims are completely disingenuous. What you need to know is that both the sulfate-free cleansing agents and the sulfate versions can be drying and sensitizing depending on the formulation and/or your skin’s own reaction. All of these cleansing agents remove oil and the gunk from styling products, which is exactly what a shampoo should do.</p>, <p>“Sulfates in cleansers are cheap.” This one is true, but so what? Lots of ingredients, both natural and synthetic, are cheap, others are expensive, which has absolutely nothing to do with quality or efficacy. The first ingredient in sulfate-free shampoos is water (about 90% water) and no other cosmetic ingredient is cheaper than that!</p>, <p>“Sulfates are used in floor cleaners and are corrosive.” This can be true, when used in large amounts and when left on surfaces over time, but so what? Salt is used to melt ice on the roadway, but it also rusts cars, which doesn’t make salt bad; it just depends on how much you use and how long you leave it on something. This is also true for the alternative sulfate-free shampoos and cleansers as well; they can also be corrosive over time depending on how much is used and how long it is left on.</p>, <p>“Sulfates can be sensitizing.” This can absolutely be true, but again, so what? As a general category, sulfates are not sensitizing when used in appropriate amounts in shampoos and cleansers and the same is true for sulfate-free alternative cleansing agents. All of the research about sulfates being sensitizing are from patch tests where a concentration is left on skin under a bandage for 24 hours, which is not how a cleanser or shampoo is used. Sodium lauryl sulfate is considered one of the more sensitizing cleansing agents and we recommend avoiding it when it is high up on the ingredient list, but that’s NOT because it’s a sulfate; rather, it’s because of its interaction with skin.</p>]

[<p>Naturally occurring mineral composed of magnesium, hydrogen, oxygen, and silicon which combine to form what’s known as anhydrous (contains no water) magnesium silicate. Talc is often the main ingredient in loose and pressed face powders, powder foundations, and body powders for adults and children. It may also be used in skin care products where it serves as an absorbent. Talc is also used in some liquid foundations and concealers, where it adds opacity and contributes to the makeup’s texture.</p>, <p>An ongoing concern with talc since the 1970s has been whether it contains asbestos fibers known as chrysotile, which pose a serious risk to lung health when inhaled. Talc can become contaminated with these fibers during the mining process because asbestos (also a naturally-occurring mineral) is found in nature in close proximity to talc. This is why the selection of talc mining sites is so important, as is screening all talc batches for the presence of asbestos fibers.</p>, <p>The screening process mentioned above is something the United States Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) has been actively doing with commercially-available talc-containing products for several years. They’re routinely announcing to the public which talc-containing products do and do not contain asbestos. Thankfully, the majority of such products do <strong>not</strong> contain this carcinogen and are considered safe when used as directed. Talc-containing products that testing shows <strong>do</strong> have asbestos are routinely recalled. This includes talc-based body powders from major brands like Johnson &amp; Johnson, who’ve been subject to ongoing litigation concerning allegations of the presence of asbestos in their talc products.</p>, <p>Consumers who remain concerned about whether the talc-containing products they use contain asbestos are advised to contact the brand and ask about batch certification testing to ensure the safety of these products. But we must acknowledge the public record the talc industry at large has of providing misleading information in order to conceal potential risk, justifying ongoing consumer skepticism.</p>, <p>Alternately, you may wish to avoid all personal care products that contain talc and seek alternatives such as those made with other absorbents like corn starch, rice powder, silica, boron nitride, nylon-12, and responsibly-mined mica, or various other non-talc ingredients.</p>, <p>Overall, despite ongoing controversies and legal issues, asbestos-free talc is considered safe for use in makeup and skin care, although it’s recommended to avoid applying loose powder talc in the genital area. According to the formal safety assessment completed in 2015, “Industry specifications state that cosmetic-grade talc must contain no detectable fibrous, asbestos minerals.” They go on to caution that “Talc should not be applied to the skin when the epidermal barrier is missing or significantly disrupted”, which makes sense given talc is not meant to get into the body, it is meant to stay on skin’s surface.</p>, <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 2020</p>, <p><strong>References for this information:</strong><br/><em>Epidemiology</em>, November 2019, pages 783-788<br/><em>American Journal of Public Health</em>, July 2019, pages 969-974<br/><em>JNCI Cancer Spectrum</em>, April 2018, ePublication<br/><em>Risk Analysis</em>, May 2017, pages 918-929; and July 2016, ePublication<br/><em>International Journal of Toxicology</em>, July-August 2015, Supplement, pages 66S-129S<br/><em>European Journal of Cancer Prevention</em>, November 2011, pages 501-507; and April 2008, pages 139-146</p>]
